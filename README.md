# Diamond Price Prediction

The Diamond Price Prediction project is a production-grade machine learning application that utilizes advanced algorithms to predict the price of diamonds. The codebase follows a structured and organized format, making it easy to maintain and scale. With a well-defined folder structure and modular components, the project promotes code reusability and extensibility.

The application includes a web integration using Flask, allowing users to interact with the prediction model through a user-friendly interface. Users can input diamond characteristics, and the application will provide an estimate of the diamond's price based on the trained machine learning model.

The project's main components include data ingestion, data transformation, and model training, each encapsulated within their respective modules. The data pipelines ensure that the data is processed and transformed efficiently, while the model trainer module trains the machine learning model using the provided datasets.

Additionally, the project includes Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model training, facilitating transparency and reproducibility. The README file provides detailed instructions on setting up the development environment and deploying the application.

Overall, the Diamond Price Prediction project combines machine learning techniques, Flask web integration, and a well-structured codebase to deliver an accurate and user-friendly solution for predicting diamond prices.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following software installed:

Python 3.x: Download and install Python

### Installing

Follow the steps below to set up the development environment:
Run the following command in powershell or command prompt

1. Clone The repository

```
git clone https://github.com/tkm-devil/Diamond-Price-Prediction.git
cd DiamondPricePrediction
```

2. Create a virtual environment inside DiamondPricePrediction

```
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
env\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Start the Flask application:

```
python application.py
```

5. Access the application in your web browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000
